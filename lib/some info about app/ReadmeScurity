It looks like the code snippet you provided is a configuration for hashing using the SCRYPT algorithm. SCRYPT is a key derivation function designed to be secure against hardware brute-force attacks.

Let me break down the components of the configuration:

Algorithm: SCRYPT
Base64 Signer Key: This is a cryptographic key used in the signing process. It's a base64-encoded key represented by the string 2pi1YBFEIJjm52+pWGGKty+HoDP2jDVCK3bq9ZxDVKyzAUYlZqgQUSOABtHRCWHCXVr6DRe7jXjZ/DrABXzHrg==.
Base64 Salt Separator: This is another cryptographic component used in the hashing process. It's a base64-encoded value represented by the string Bw==.
Rounds: The number of iterations or rounds the algorithm performs. In this case, it's set to 8.
Memory Cost: This parameter (often denoted as N or mem_cost) defines the amount of memory used by the algorithm. In this case, it's set to 14.
This configuration is commonly used in security-related applications, such as password hashing, where it's important to slow down attackers by making the computation of the hash more resource-intensive.
